Code not yet public, please send me an email at bmalone05@qub.ac.uk to request.

The corresponding code for the research paper I wrote early 2017. You can find that [here](https://github.com/blmalone/Papers-and-Resume/blob/master/Dissertation_Blaine%20Malone.pdf).
Main features of the application can be found in the paper.

Currently lacking in **integration/unit tests** for various components of the system. For the purposes of the research paper all the **smart contract code is extensively tested**. If application ever enters a production environment then test coverage will be dramatically increased before.

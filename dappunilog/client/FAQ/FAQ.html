                    <li><u>Why Unilog?</u></li>
                    <h5>Information is usually accepted as legitimate at face value. In many cases information that is
                    presented to you could have been tampered with prior to your inspection. Unilog provides solution to
                    this problem.<br/>
                    We utilise the <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" class="link-no-blue">Ethereum</a> block chain for recording the existence of data. Couple this with the
                    <a href="https://ipfs.io/" class="link-no-blue">IPFS</a> distributed file system for the storage of data, and we have a powerful solution that gives users
                    a seamless experience with the added benefits of these cutting edge technologies.
                        Users of the service can be sure that data which is storage against the block chain is legitimate.</h5>

                    <li><u>Who is the target audience?</u></li>
                    <h5>The best way to answer this question is to describe a typical use case.<br/>
                    University 'X' runs a degree in Computer Science which has 100 students participating in the class.<br/>
                    The university wants to minimise the amount of requests they receive from outside companies/recruiters
                    asking for verification of a candidates results/qualifications. These companies and recruiters want
                    to ensure that they are working with a credible candidate. The university would rather free up their time
                    for more productive tasks on a daily basis.<br/><br/>

                    The solution is to provide a platform whereby the above work flow can occur autonomously.<br/>
                    It works like so: <br/><br/>
                    <ol>
                        <li>University 'X' uploads transcripts of all 100 students that completed the degree in Computer Science.</li>
                        <li>Unilog publishes each transcript to the block chain and adds the transcript data to a <a href="https://ipfs.io/" class="link-no-blue">distributed file system.</a></li>
                        <li>A student 'Y' is emailed a token which identifies their transcript on the block chain.</li>
                        <li>The student can advertise this token as they please. A common place to attach it would be a CV.</li>
                        <li>Company 'Z' receives a CV from student 'Y' containing a Unilog token.</li>
                        <li>Company 'Z' enters this token into Unilogs <a href="http://dapps.ethercasts.com/" class="link-no-blue">Decentralised Application</a> to verify that the transcript details on the CV are the same as those stored by University 'X' at the initial step.</li>
                        <li>Within seconds, company 'Z' will be able to tell whether the CV is telling the truth or not.</li>
                    </ol></h5>
                    <br/><br/><br/>
                    <li><u>How can I create an Ethereum Account to start using Unilog?</u></li>
                    <h5>
                        There are many ways to create an Ethereum account. Here we will outline the simplest ways to get started.<br/>
                        To get started quickly, we would advise installing the
                        <a href="https://metamask.io/" class="link-no-blue">MetaMask </a> Chrome extension. Here you can
                        create an account and bring Ethereum to your browser. This is by far the most user friendly option.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Another option is to create an account using <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/cli" class="link-no-blue">Geth</a>.
                        This command line tool runs a local Ethereum node so that you can communicate with the main Ethereum network but it also allows you
                        to create and import existing accounts.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Finally, if you want to create a standalone Ethereum account for importing to a preferred implementation of the protocol,
                        you can use <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/" class="link-no-blue">My Ether Wallet</a>.
                        They provide some useful features for making sure you do not forget your account information.

                    <li><u>What are the benefits of Unilog over traditional approaches?</u></li>
                    <h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once you have an Ethereum account, you can freely use Unilog without any other registration.</li>
                            <li>Cryptographic security is built in by standard. Data presented by Unilog can only ever be issued by
                                the intended issuer.
                            </li>
                            <li>Data is available forever</li>
                            <li>Extreme levels of fault tolerance, zero downtime</li>
                            <li>Decentralized peer-to-peer network</li>
                            <li>Users are in complete control of their data. They can remove their association with a piece of data directly without relying on a central server to do so.</li>
                            <li>Only takes seconds to verify that a piece of data legitimate.</li>
                        </ul>

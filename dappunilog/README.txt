This is an application using the Meteor JS framework. It will be a decentralised application that exists within the Ethereum network. It will allow users of the network to communicate/interact with the Unilog service. 

The application may be accessed through the MIST browser for Ethereum. Or an user may run the application locally and make sure that they have their local Ethereum node running. 

What if a user already has an ethereum account and they want to use our Unilog service? 
 - We would suggest that they stick with the decentralised application. This will provided  the same functionality as the centralised app without registration. (Mist, would take care of this/An Ethereum Wallet.)

What if a user has already registered with the unilog service and decides on using the decentralized app for future interactions? 
 - In this case we would securely supply the user with their keyfile. This is their pub and private key. There are many ways in which a user can access a DApp. Depending on their situation, they will follow certain protocol. Specific steps will be outlined in a separate wiki.
